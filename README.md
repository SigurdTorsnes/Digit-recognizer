# Digit-recognizer how to run

Make sure MNIST-images.npy and MNIST-labels.npy are in the same folder as model_selection.ipynb. From here you simply need to run the model_selection.ipynb file from top to bottom and the best classifier should be chosen at the end of the file. The Data_exploration.ipynb file is pretty much a playground for exploring the data, here are some of the plots used in the report, this can be run top to bottom to see the plots. This file is not actually needed for the model selection, since we do all of the preproccesing over again in model_selection.ipynb
